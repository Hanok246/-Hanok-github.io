            Hello everyone, My full name is Hanok Lungeli. I was born on 22nd of February 2003 in Nepal. I have a small family of only 3 members
            they are me, my father and my mother. <br>
            I was always a good grader student from a young age. Raising up as a student that understood the importance of education, I was ever
            eager for further studies. It was not until long at my teenage when I piqued my interest in learning about computers. I am a quick 
            leaner therefore, learning basic computing techniques were easy for me. However, learning a professional concept of computer
            programming required a proper guidance. Therefore, I enrolled as an undergraduate student at Georgian at ILAC College in Toronto.
            This will be my first time creating and designing a webpage.
            <br>
            Also talking about my hobbies I like to go on treks and sing. As a person aligning from a country with
            lots of mountains and hills, trekking and hiking is the best personality that would fit me. Here are 
            few glimpse's of my trek.  <br>
